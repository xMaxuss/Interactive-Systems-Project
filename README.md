# Interactive-Systems-Project

This repository includes the code of my current interactive systems project. It may be updated at a later time. The project will be focused of creating a "reaction game" using the Arduino Uno circuit board and some conductive materials.


For now, only the code of my very first prototype will be included. This prototype has a simple purpose: when one of the 8 LEDs turns on, it can be turned off by pressing the corresponding button (1-8). If the incorrect button is pressed, nothing happens. When the correct button is pressed, the LED turns off and another, randomly choosen LED turn on. A randomly chosen LED turns off when the correct button is pressed, the Arduino is turned on or if the Arduino is reset (with the big red button).

This first prototype does not have much game logic integrated into it yet, it will all come at a later time as I am working on the project.



Still getting to know GitHub, checking how to operate it.
