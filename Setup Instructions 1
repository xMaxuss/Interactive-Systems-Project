This file will explain, how exactly "First PHYSICAL Prototype" needs to be created. It will list all the necessary materials and will tell how they need to be used.

Materials needed:
5 1kOhm resistors, 4 220Ohm resistors, 5 4-pin buttons, a piezo sound output, 4 LEDs (any color), a 4-digit-7-segment-display, a medium breadboard (contains + and - lines, has 10x64 pin slots) an Arduino Uno (or similar), a bunch of wires.
